What began as simple curiosity quickly turned into a serious commitment. I stayed up late many nights, pushing through exhaustion, confusion, and countless errors while trying to understand complex Kubernetes concepts. In just over four months, all that effort paid off when I became a Kubestronaut at the age of 19! The journey so far wasn't easy, but it strengthened my discipline and deepened my passion for cloud-native technologies. Today, I continue to build on that foundation by improving my programming skills, exploring modern infrastructure and software development, and diving into emerging areas such as AI and Agentic AI.<p>",

Later, I moved to Austria to pursue a master’s degree in Sustainable Energy Systems, which led me to an internship at the Fraunhofer Institute in Kassel. There, I completed my master’s thesis, bridging my earlier academic background with applications in AI.  After graduating, I began working as a data analyst, where I became involved in projects that introduced me to DevOps and MLOps. Driven by curiosity and a hands-on learning approach, I built my own local lab environment to deepen my skills. This journey eventually led me to pursue CNCF certifications, culminating in the achievement of the Kubestronaut badge, a milestone that reflects my passion for cloud-native technologies and continuous learning.  Whenever possible, I actively participate in the CNCF Cloud Native Linz community, sharing knowledge and learning from peers. Through these experiences, I continue to grow my expertise while contributing to the broader cloud-native ecosystem.</p>",

I love building reliable, scalable systems and finding joy in the small details that make big things work.  Currently, I’m a Platform Engineer at InstaDeep, where collaboration, growth, and lifting each other up are at the heart of what we do.

When US funding cuts ended that path, I realized academia left me without agency.</p><p>In the private sector, I discovered the value of risk. The Cloud Native paradigm let me experiment, fail fast, and try again without fear of lasting damage. In positive-sum collaborations, I saw how my algorithms could shape real-world outcomes, and how taking calculated risks created visible change for people and systems alike. This freedom to test ideas with relatively low cost revealed a new kind of agency, an immediacy and measurable connection to the meaning of work.</p><p>My vision is to empower others to leverage cloud native technology with respect for the human element, security, and risk. Because having agency means creating reality for our society, for each one of us, one epsilon at a time.</p>",

Over the last 3 years, she advocated for the adoption of open-source technologies within the Spanish-speaking community, creating and supporting tech meetups and events in the region. She co-created, along with her team, the first Kubernetes Community Days in Colombia. This event paved the way for the expansion of Cloud Native Groups throughout the region. Cristher's foresight and operational expertise have been fundamental to the success of both Cuemby and the Cloud Native Latam Group. Recognizing the region's need for in-depth knowledge of cloud-native applications, Cristher championed the LFS250 (Linux Foundation Course) and administered the KCNA certifications donated by CNCF to the region. These two initiatives heightened awareness of cloud-native technologies and certifications, fortifying local proficiency in open-source solutions. She continues to promote and advocate for the recognition of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) in the region, addressing both business and community aspects. Cristher's leadership and operational prowess exemplify her unwavering commitment to fostering a thriving Latam tech community. https://community.cncf.io/cloud-native-latin-america/ https://community.cncf.io/cloud-native-medellin/ https://www.cncf.io/reports/kcd-colombia-2023/ https://www.cuemby.com/about-us https://www.linkedin.com/company/fundaci%C3%B3n-hispana-de-cloud-native/?viewAsMember=true https://community.cncf.io/cloud-native-colombia/ https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/kcd-colombia/?viewAsMember=truehttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/kcd-colombia</p><p>Why I am excited to be an ambassador: Becoming a CNCF ambassador empowers me to further my dedication to community growth in the LATAM region. I deeply believe that the region's success hinges on the symbiotic collaboration of professionals, students, and companies. It's this harmony that forms the core of my mission: to cultivate a thriving community ecosystem centered around open-source and cloud-native technologies. Through this role, I am positioned to amplify awareness about these technologies and the transformative opportunities they introduce. My operational and logistics expertise is set to facilitate more meetups and events, thus kindling the formation of new communities. Collaborating with fellow leaders and ambassadors provides a unique platform to unite our efforts, ensuring we collectively advance our shared vision.</p>",

Armed with coffee and an insatiable appetite for automation, I transform mundane tasks into elegant solutions while Kubernetes keeps me humble with its delightful complexities.  As a devoted servant of Jesus Christ, I approach technology with the same dedication as my faith. When not wrestling with cloud infrastructure, you'll find me exploring new technologies and tools, always curious to learn what's next in the tech world. I embrace a minimalist lifestyle, finding joy in simplicity both in code and in life.  My love affair with Kubernetes stems from its beautiful chaos - where community-driven solutions tackle real-world problems head-on. Like a digital shepherd, I guide applications through the cloud, learning and growing alongside an amazing community of problem solvers.  Think of me as your friendly neighbourhood automation enthusiast, fueled by coffee and powered by faith, always ready to transform complex challenges into elegant solutions. Because in the end, technology is not just about code - it's about building bridges and growing together.  Life's journey isn't just about conquering technical challenges; it's about leaving footprints of kindness and knowledge for others to follow. After all, the greatest legacy we can leave behind is not in the systems we build, but in the lives we touch through sharing and caring.  Personal Blog: https://bookofdaniel.in/</p>",

I started my journey in the field of virtualization and cloud technology from 2015 until now. Physical to Virtual (P2V) and Virtual to Virtual (V2V) are the first experiences in virtualization projects that know the basics of cloud computing.  I started planning, assessing and building cloud computing in my company since the end of 2019 by conducting several cloud technology assessment tenders and selecting hyperscalers (cloud provider) according to my company's use cases. our challenge is how we maximize the benefits of cloud computing by migrating monolithic applications to microservices from on-premises to cloud using hyperscaler, with microservices we will have agile delivery to support rapid Go to Market (GTM) from a business point of view, we can support multiple deployments or sprint releases according to the business requirements program every week, it is much easier to maintain our applications / services independently and much more. Therefore, we realize the need to have microservices knowledge by understanding in-depth knowledge of the Kubernetes Platform to support this so that we will have an agile environment that can support our business growth and provide added value and competitive advantage for digital transformation in our company. I started learning Kubernetes from 2022 until now to support all kinds of applications/services migrating to microservices in the cloud. by fully understanding this knowledge we can maximize the value of kubernetes to support our business in our company.</p>",

I’ve spent years in the trenches of Kubernetes, container hardening, CI/CD pipelines, and all the alphabet soup that makes enterprise engineers sweat.  I’ve got a PhD in Information Assurance, but don’t worry — I use it for good. I write policies that make sense, tools that make life easier, and training that helps people actually get it.  When I’m not wrangling YAML or chasing zero CVEs, I’m running King Butter — my hot sauce and seasoning brand that’s fit for royalty — and recording music under my label, Royal Anthem Records.

During the last years, I've acquired solid skills in designing and setting up cloud-native oriented architectures relying on various container engines, OpenShift and Kubernetes. The main focus being integrating those complex platforms in on-prem trusted, secured and compliant environments, as well as designing more hybrid setups in AWS and Azure.  Those state of the art container platforms bring tremendous agility features to micro services integration, but there are nothing without proper governance and without using the right tools sets depending on a wide range of contexts and use cases.  The cloud native world and its vast eco-system is evolving at high pace and today's challenge for many companies is to make sure they're not outrun by this strong wind of change in the digital transformation race. It's furthermore also important to understand all those concepts, the way they interact and their many impacts.</p>",

Apart from that, I run a crypto-trading pet project that has successfully used CloudNativePG in production for the past year - a CNCF sandbox project I highly recommend to check and have also contributed to. Outside of tech, my biggest passion is inline skating; I’ve been skating since the age of ten and actively promote this hobby among my close friends.</p>",

I've since come to appreciate all Kubernetes can do and also what its limitations are and when NOT to use it. I've taught DevOps courses and Kubernetes courses while also helping large enterprises setup internally managed Kubernetes platforms with a product based mindset. I believe that security is so fundamental to everything that we do, we shouldn't be shoving it in as an afterthought with DevSecOps",

Since 2012 I have earned my stripes as software engineer and for the last 6 years designed, created and maintained Kubernetes based architectures in multi-tenancy environments, crafted a fair share of CI/CD-Pipelines on various different platforms, managed application deployments (leveraging both, best-practices and, in hindsight, not-so-good practices), implemented automations to streamline workflows and overall helped development teams to ship their products faster and reliable, all while keeping a watchful eye on security. I do not hold any degree in CS but I am equipped with unstoppable drive to eventually „figure things out“. Currently I am working as a consultant, guiding and assisting clients to adopt cloud native technologies and to build, maintain and operate cloud (Azure) and hybrid infrastructures. </p>",

I also worked as an Open Source Developer in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) at DBpedia Association. Apart from my technical experience, I got my hands dirty in fostering the Cloud Native Ecosystem. I am also the Chapter Lead at Cloud Native Hooghly which is an official CNCF Chapter listed amongst 40 such clubs in the Asia Pacific Region. Right now, with the proliferation of the Cloud Native Tools, I successfully turned the chapter to be the fastest growing in the entire Eastern India, catering 250+ Active members. I am also a Sig Contribex's Comms Volunteer for Kubernetes Contributors Summit North America 2023 at Chicago, United States of America primarily looking into the “Call for Proposal” emails and notifying about the updates to the KubeCon co-located event attendees. I have significant experience in pitching tech products to Venture Capitalists and have successfully secured grants from Government of India twice for my deep-tech startup.</p><p>Why I am excited to be an ambassador: I always wanted to boost Cloud Native Ecosystem in my locality whereas I felt there is a gap of awareness. Being an ambassador, it would really help me to reach areas where I couldn't do by myself just being a CNCG chapter lead of Hooghly. With CNCF's support it would be possible.</p>",

All that apart, I'm music-passionate and a restless shower performer, a winter couch knitter and cat cuddler, a balcony gardening ace, a dabble baker, and a great backwarmer during adventurous motorcycle journeys.</p><p>Why I am excited to be an ambassador: Being a non-tech member and a proud CNCF ambassador, I'm determined to lend my support in any way possible. I'm here to share the lessons I've learned, contribute to the growth of our community, and empower others to discover the Cloud Native Community and find their own path. I want to be a guiding hand to help others navigate CNCF initiatives and projects. It's all about showing that there are different ways to contribute and various subgroups tailored to their expertise. </p>",

His practical knowledge and adaptability in these environments make him a valuable asset to any tech team.  While enjoying his advanced Linux computer janitor role, he slowly got tired of the toil involved with hand-rolling new servers and juggling shared libraries. Seeking a better way to bin-pack applications, he began advocating the use of containers; however, this didn't remove the need to hand-roll servers, so his journey led him to explore Kubernetes, where he quickly gained a taste for monitoring workloads with Prometheus and empowering his colleagues to make metrics-driven decisions.  Having worked with Kubernetes and its abstractions, Tobias still prefers his simple command line for most tasks. He firmly believes in the UNIX philosophy and KISS principles, even if daily driving Emacs might go against these principles.</p>",

My journey began in enterprise integration, where I learned how complex systems talk to each other. Today, I channel that foundation into Kubernetes, cloud, and identity‑driven architectures that make the cloud not just powerful but practical.<p/><p>I live where cloud, containers, clusters, and cost optimization collide. By day I design and deploy resilient solutions that balance speed, security, and cost, cutting through complexity, automating the repetitive, and building infrastructure that runs with intent.<p/><p>I don’t just deploy workloads, I translate them. Whether it’s a workflow that saves hours or a policy that finally makes sense, I turn cloud chaos into clarity. With DevSecOps practices at the core of my work, I embed security into pipelines and architectures so teams can innovate quickly without sacrificing trust.  When I’m not deep in YAML, clusters, or threat models, I’m learning the next skill that keeps me relevant in an ever‑changing cloud‑native ecosystem.</p>",

During my early days in the industry I came across free and open-source operating systems of Linux, which I'm still, till the present day, a great fan of. Being a Linux user for more than a decade, I've changed that passion to a profession.  With an insatiable appetite to learn and readily support new technologies, I'm seeking for new challenges on daily basis. Challenges that make me a better professional.  On the road to perfection, my scope of interests stays wide, including Unix and Linux operating systems, all aspects of networking, including IT security, down to programming.  I can fairly say I'm a happy man, cause what I do for a living is my truly passion.</p>",
