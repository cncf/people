I feel this can truly help foster projects in the open source way. I have seen the space of projects grow and fully understand the challenges associated with scaling projects while still trying to maintain legitimacy and fairness in this Cloud Native community. Being a committer to the Ambari project and contributor to Kubernetes, I have worked across industries and communities and am sought as a trusted advisor and technical architect for the Kubernetes Storage SIG. As part of the Storage SIG I helped establish an E2E testing framework focused on real use cases from customers and usability of the system. I have consulted with other Kubernetes SIGs from this work to help grow the ecosystem with the vision of a more stable environment. I am dedicated to open source and the growing of the cloud native community to incorporate the tools that make this ecosystem so powerful. I bring to the table the perspective of both a developer, tester and usability fanatic and continually reach across communities to accomplish these shared goals. With my new role at Apple participating as an end user of Kubernetes gives me a fully holistic view I can contribute to evaluating and identifying technologies to continue to grow our Cloud Native community.</p>",
