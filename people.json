      "bio": "<p>Cristher Castro, co-founder and COO of Cuemby, is a visionary leader and operational dynamo who drives community building in the Latam tech scene. Over the last 3 years, she advocated for the adoption of open-source technologies within the Spanish-speaking community, creating and supporting tech meetups and events in the region. She co-created, along with her team, the first Kubernetes Community Days in Colombia. This event paved the way for the expansion of Cloud Native Groups throughout the region. Cristher's foresight and operational expertise have been fundamental to the success of both Cuemby and the Cloud Native Latam Group. Recognizing the region's need for in-depth knowledge of cloud-native applications, Cristher championed the LFS250 (Linux Foundation Course) and administered the KCNA certifications donated by CNCF to the region. These two initiatives heightened awareness of cloud-native technologies and certifications, fortifying local proficiency in open-source solutions. She continues to promote and advocate for the recognition of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) in the region, addressing both business and community aspects. Cristher's leadership and operational prowess exemplify her unwavering commitment to fostering a thriving Latam tech community. https://community.cncf.io/cloud-native-latin-america/ https://community.cncf.io/cloud-native-medellin/ https://www.cncf.io/reports/kcd-colombia-2023/ https://www.cuemby.com/about-us https://www.linkedin.com/company/fundaci%C3%B3n-hispana-de-cloud-native/?viewAsMember=true https://community.cncf.io/cloud-native-colombia/ https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/kcd-colombia/?viewAsMember=truehttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/kcd-colombia</p><p>Why I am excited to be an ambassador: Becoming a CNCF ambassador empowers me to further my dedication to community growth in the LATAM region. I deeply believe that the region's success hinges on the symbiotic collaboration of professionals, students, and companies. It's this harmony that forms the core of my mission: to cultivate a thriving community ecosystem centered around open-source and cloud-native technologies. Through this role, I am positioned to amplify awareness about these technologies and the transformative opportunities they introduce. My operational and logistics expertise is set to facilitate more meetups and events, thus kindling the formation of new communities. Collaborating with fellow leaders and ambassadors provides a unique platform to unite our efforts, ensuring we collectively advance our shared vision.</p>",

Along with my academics, I have maintained a strong portfolio being an Open Source Developer at the projects incubated and graduated from The Linux Foundation and Cloud Native Computing Foundation. My enthusiasm with DevOps and Cloud Native helped me to secure scholarships like Travel Funding Scholarship and Dan Kohn Scholarship by The Linux Foundation and Cloud Native Computing Foundation to attend flagship conferences such as KubeCon + CloudNativeCon + Open Source Summit China 2023 at Shanghai and Open Source Summit Europe 2022 at Dublin. I also worked as an Open Source Developer in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) at DBpedia Association. Apart from my technical experience, I got my hands dirty in fostering the Cloud Native Ecosystem. I am also the Chapter Lead at Cloud Native Hooghly which is an official CNCF Chapter listed amongst 40 such clubs in the Asia Pacific Region. Right now, with the proliferation of the Cloud Native Tools, I successfully turned the chapter to be the fastest growing in the entire Eastern India, catering 250+ Active members. I am also a Sig Contribex's Comms Volunteer for Kubernetes Contributors Summit North America 2023 at Chicago, United States of America primarily looking into the “Call for Proposal” emails and notifying about the updates to the KubeCon co-located event attendees. I have significant experience in pitching tech products to Venture Capitalists and have successfully secured grants from Government of India twice for my deep-tech startup.</p><p>Why I am excited to be an ambassador: I always wanted to boost Cloud Native Ecosystem in my locality whereas I felt there is a gap of awareness. Being an ambassador, it would really help me to reach areas where I couldn't do by myself just being a CNCG chapter lead of Hooghly. With CNCF's support it would be possible.</p>",

      "bio": "<p>I started my journey in Tech Marketing in 2016, and in 2021, I embarked with SIGHUP on the Cloud Native industry as a complete newbie. For the first six months, I felt overwhelmed by the vastness and complexity of the field, but then something amazing happened along the way – thanks to my stubbornness and the patient support of my colleagues, I actively started contributing to the Cloud Native community and found a perfect place to express my skills while helping others, organizing events, and supporting projects - I'm a KCD Italy and Cloud Native Milano Meetup organizer and part of the Glossary Italian Localization Group. All that apart, I'm music-passionate and a restless shower performer, a winter couch knitter and cat cuddler, a balcony gardening ace, a dabble baker, and a great backwarmer during adventurous motorcycle journeys.</p><p>Why I am excited to be an ambassador: Being a non-tech member and a proud CNCF ambassador, I'm determined to lend my support in any way possible. I'm here to share the lessons I've learned, contribute to the growth of our community, and empower others to discover the Cloud Native Community and find their own path. I want to be a guiding hand to help others navigate CNCF initiatives and projects. It's all about showing that there are different ways to contribute and various subgroups tailored to their expertise. </p>",
