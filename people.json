Over the last 3 years, she advocated for the adoption of open-source technologies within the Spanish-speaking community, creating and supporting tech meetups and events in the region. She co-created, along with her team, the first Kubernetes Community Days in Colombia. This event paved the way for the expansion of Cloud Native Groups throughout the region. Cristher's foresight and operational expertise have been fundamental to the success of both Cuemby and the Cloud Native Latam Group. Recognizing the region's need for in-depth knowledge of cloud-native applications, Cristher championed the LFS250 (Linux Foundation Course) and administered the KCNA certifications donated by CNCF to the region. These two initiatives heightened awareness of cloud-native technologies and certifications, fortifying local proficiency in open-source solutions. She continues to promote and advocate for the recognition of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) in the region, addressing both business and community aspects. Cristher's leadership and operational prowess exemplify her unwavering commitment to fostering a thriving Latam tech community. https://community.cncf.io/cloud-native-latin-america/ https://community.cncf.io/cloud-native-medellin/ https://www.cncf.io/reports/kcd-colombia-2023/ https://www.cuemby.com/about-us https://www.linkedin.com/company/fundaci%C3%B3n-hispana-de-cloud-native/?viewAsMember=true https://community.cncf.io/cloud-native-colombia/ https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/kcd-colombia/?viewAsMember=truehttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/kcd-colombia</p><p>Why I am excited to be an ambassador: Becoming a CNCF ambassador empowers me to further my dedication to community growth in the LATAM region. I deeply believe that the region's success hinges on the symbiotic collaboration of professionals, students, and companies. It's this harmony that forms the core of my mission: to cultivate a thriving community ecosystem centered around open-source and cloud-native technologies. Through this role, I am positioned to amplify awareness about these technologies and the transformative opportunities they introduce. My operational and logistics expertise is set to facilitate more meetups and events, thus kindling the formation of new communities. Collaborating with fellow leaders and ambassadors provides a unique platform to unite our efforts, ensuring we collectively advance our shared vision.</p>",

Physical to Virtual (P2V) and Virtual to Virtual (V2V) are the first experiences in virtualization projects that know the basics of cloud computing.  I started planning, assessing and building cloud computing in my company since the end of 2019 by conducting several cloud technology assessment tenders and selecting hyperscalers (cloud provider) according to my company's use cases. our challenge is how we maximize the benefits of cloud computing by migrating monolithic applications to microservices from on-premises to cloud using hyperscaler, with microservices we will have agile delivery to support rapid Go to Market (GTM) from a business point of view, we can support multiple deployments or sprint releases according to the business requirements program every week, it is much easier to maintain our applications / services independently and much more. Therefore, we realize the need to have microservices knowledge by understanding in-depth knowledge of the Kubernetes Platform to support this so that we will have an agile environment that can support our business growth and provide added value and competitive advantage for digital transformation in our company. I started learning Kubernetes from 2022 until now to support all kinds of applications/services migrating to microservices in the cloud. by fully understanding this knowledge we can maximize the value of kubernetes to support our business in our company.</p>",

The main focus being integrating those complex platforms in on-prem trusted, secured and compliant environments, as well as designing more hybrid setups in AWS and Azure.  Those state of the art container platforms bring tremendous agility features to micro services integration, but there are nothing without proper governance and without using the right tools sets depending on a wide range of contexts and use cases.  The cloud native world and its vast eco-system is evolving at high pace and today's challenge for many companies is to make sure they're not outrun by this strong wind of change in the digital transformation race.

When she’s not connecting dots in the community, you can find her pursuing photography, cooking, and sipping on chai lattes.</p><p>Why I am excited to be an ambassador: Having help build this community since 2015, I'm fascinated by how far the ecosystem has come and how much further it can go. I'm extremely excited to see CNCF participate in new spaces and so with my continued work as a CNCF Ambassador, I look forward to helping bridge the gap between the cloud native and Webassembly communities.</p>",

He is one of the core maintainers of Dex, a Cloud Native identity federation solution and a number of Go libraries (Viper being the most prominent among them). Márk also organizes several tech meetups in Hungary (Go Budapest, Kubernetes and Cloud Native Budapest, Microservices Budapest) and regularly appears as a speaker in the region at meetups, workshops, conferences and podcasts. You can occasionally find him posting to his blog (https://sagikazarmark.hu/), but chances are his GitHub profile is more interesting. In his free time, Márk likes riding a bicycle, reading books, but his favorite hobby for more than 20 years has been Hungarian folk dance.</p><p>Why I am excited to be an ambassador: I always liked learning/building new technologies and then sharing the knowledge with others. By working on various Open Source projects for more than a decade I also learned to appreciate the opportunity to learn from people coming from different backgrounds. By being an ambassador I hope that I'll have more opportunities to connect with people, learn from them and maybe share some of my knowledge as well.</p>",

The way that the foundation has supported the community and the projects is truly admirable. Even though I have other honorary titles, the CNCF Ambassador title is one that I value very much. While I don't do community work for the titles, I am happy for the recognition. I have big plans for my work in the CNCF, and I look forward to seeing how the ambassador program will help me achieve more for the community.</p><p>Sessionize: https://sessionize.com/roberth-strand</p>",

I also worked as an Open Source Developer in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) at DBpedia Association. Apart from my technical experience, I got my hands dirty in fostering the Cloud Native Ecosystem.

Seeking a better way to bin-pack applications, he began advocating the use of containers; however, this didn't remove the need to hand-roll servers, so his journey led him to explore Kubernetes, where he quickly gained a taste for monitoring workloads with Prometheus and empowering his colleagues to make metrics-driven decisions.  Having worked with Kubernetes and its abstractions, Tobias still prefers his simple command line for most tasks.
