She co-created, along with her team, the first Kubernetes Community Days in Colombia. This event paved the way for the expansion of Cloud Native Groups throughout the region. Cristher's foresight and operational expertise have been fundamental to the success of both Cuemby and the Cloud Native Latam Group. Recognizing the region's need for in-depth knowledge of cloud-native applications, Cristher championed the LFS250 (Linux Foundation Course) and administered the KCNA certifications donated by CNCF to the region. These two initiatives heightened awareness of cloud-native technologies and certifications, fortifying local proficiency in open-source solutions. She continues to promote and advocate for the recognition of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) in the region, addressing both business and community aspects.

It's this harmony that forms the core of my mission: to cultivate a thriving community ecosystem centered around open-source and cloud-native technologies. Through this role, I am positioned to amplify awareness about these technologies and the transformative opportunities they introduce. My operational and logistics expertise is set to facilitate more meetups and events, thus kindling the formation of new communities.

Armed with coffee and an insatiable appetite for automation, I transform mundane tasks into elegant solutions while Kubernetes keeps me humble with its delightful complexities.  As a devoted servant of Jesus Christ, I approach technology with the same dedication as my faith. When not wrestling with cloud infrastructure, you'll find me exploring new technologies and tools, always curious to learn what's next in the tech world. I embrace a minimalist lifestyle, finding joy in simplicity both in code and in life.  My love affair with Kubernetes stems from its beautiful chaos - where community-driven solutions tackle real-world problems head-on. Like a digital shepherd, I guide applications through the cloud, learning and growing alongside an amazing community of problem solvers.  Think of me as your friendly neighbourhood automation enthusiast, fueled by coffee and powered by faith, always ready to transform complex challenges into elegant solutions. Because in the end, technology is not just about code - it's about building bridges and growing together.  Life's journey isn't just about conquering technical challenges; it's about leaving footprints of kindness and knowledge for others to follow. After all, the greatest legacy we can leave behind is not in the systems we build, but in the lives we touch through sharing and caring.  Personal Blog: https://bookofdaniel.in/</p>",

I started planning, assessing and building cloud computing in my company since the end of 2019 by conducting several cloud technology assessment tenders and selecting hyperscalers (cloud provider) according to my company's use cases. our challenge is how we maximize the benefits of cloud computing by migrating monolithic applications to microservices from on-premises to cloud using hyperscaler, with microservices we will have agile delivery to support rapid Go to Market (GTM) from a business point of view, we can support multiple deployments or sprint releases according to the business requirements program every week, it is much easier to maintain our applications / services independently and much more. Therefore, we realize the need to have microservices knowledge by understanding in-depth knowledge of the Kubernetes Platform to support this so that we will have an agile environment that can support our business growth and provide added value and competitive advantage for digital transformation in our company. I started learning Kubernetes from 2022 until now to support all kinds of applications/services migrating to microservices in the cloud. by fully understanding this knowledge we can maximize the value of kubernetes to support our business in our company.</p>",

The main focus being integrating those complex platforms in on-prem trusted, secured and compliant environments, as well as designing more hybrid setups in AWS and Azure.  Those state of the art container platforms bring tremendous agility features to micro services integration, but there are nothing without proper governance and without using the right tools sets depending on a wide range of contexts and use cases.  The cloud native world and its vast eco-system is evolving at high pace and today's challenge for many companies is to make sure they're not outrun by this strong wind of change in the digital transformation race.

In recent years he has been actively involved in projects touching such diverse areas as Quantum computing, IoT, and analytics, and actively participating in the Kubernetes project as part of the Release Team, SIG Contribex, and others. He currently leads the Cloud and Architecture domain at SAS, for the South West & East Europe region. He holds a BA in Archaeology from the University of Lisbon, where he is an MA student and where he also took Physics.</p><p>Why I am excited to be an ambassador: I see being a CNCF Ambassador as a great opportunity to engage with others both in the technical aspects of cloud-native computing and in the many ways that those interested can become active members of the community. Cloud-native technology has largely been developed through open collaboration, and being an Ambassador is taking a step towards more visible participation in building the community - and learning from it.</p>",

In the CNCF, I have been active for years in TAG App Delivery, and currently serves as co-chair for the TAG, maintainer on the OpenGitOps project, and as co-chair of the Platforms Working Group.</p><p>Why I am excited to be an ambassador: For many years, the CNCF has continued to impress me. The way that the foundation has supported the community and the projects is truly admirable. Even though I have other honorary titles, the CNCF Ambassador title is one that I value very much. While I don't do community work for the titles, I am happy for the recognition. I have big plans for my work in the CNCF, and I look forward to seeing how the ambassador program will help me achieve more for the community.</p><p>Sessionize: https://sessionize.com/roberth-strand</p>",

Along with my academics, I have maintained a strong portfolio being an Open Source Developer at the projects incubated and graduated from The Linux Foundation and Cloud Native Computing Foundation. My enthusiasm with DevOps and Cloud Native helped me to secure scholarships like Travel Funding Scholarship and Dan Kohn Scholarship by The Linux Foundation and Cloud Native Computing Foundation to attend flagship conferences such as KubeCon + CloudNativeCon + Open Source Summit China 2023 at Shanghai and Open Source Summit Europe 2022 at Dublin. I also worked as an Open Source Developer in Google Summer of Code (GSoC) at DBpedia Association. Apart from my technical experience, I got my hands dirty in fostering the Cloud Native Ecosystem. I am also the Chapter Lead at Cloud Native Hooghly which is an official CNCF Chapter listed amongst 40 such clubs in the Asia Pacific Region. Right now, with the proliferation of the Cloud Native Tools, I successfully turned the chapter to be the fastest growing in the entire Eastern India, catering 250+ Active members. I am also a Sig Contribex's Comms Volunteer for Kubernetes Contributors Summit North America 2023 at Chicago, United States of America primarily looking into the “Call for Proposal” emails and notifying about the updates to the KubeCon co-located event attendees. I have significant experience in pitching tech products to Venture Capitalists and have successfully secured grants from Government of India twice for my deep-tech startup.</p><p>Why I am excited to be an ambassador: I always wanted to boost Cloud Native Ecosystem in my locality whereas I felt there is a gap of awareness. Being an ambassador, it would really help me to reach areas where I couldn't do by myself just being a CNCG chapter lead of Hooghly. With CNCF's support it would be possible.</p>",

His practical knowledge and adaptability in these environments make him a valuable asset to any tech team.  While enjoying his advanced Linux computer janitor role, he slowly got tired of the toil involved with hand-rolling new servers and juggling shared libraries. Seeking a better way to bin-pack applications, he began advocating the use of containers; however, this didn't remove the need to hand-roll servers, so his journey led him to explore Kubernetes, where he quickly gained a taste for monitoring workloads with Prometheus and empowering his colleagues to make metrics-driven decisions.  Having worked with Kubernetes and its abstractions, Tobias still prefers his simple command line for most tasks. He firmly believes in the UNIX philosophy and KISS principles, even if daily driving Emacs might go against these principles.</p>",
