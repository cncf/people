My background is quite different from my current career path: I first earned a bachelor’s degree in Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. Later, I moved to Austria to pursue a master’s degree in Sustainable Energy Systems, which led me to an internship at the Fraunhofer Institute in Kassel. There, I completed my master’s thesis, bridging my earlier academic background with applications in AI.  After graduating, I began working as a data analyst, where I became involved in projects that introduced me to DevOps and MLOps. Driven by curiosity and a hands-on learning approach, I built my own local lab environment to deepen my skills. This journey eventually led me to pursue CNCF certifications, culminating in the achievement of the Kubestronaut badge, a milestone that reflects my passion for cloud-native technologies and continuous learning.  Whenever possible, I actively participate in the CNCF Cloud Native Linz community, sharing knowledge and learning from peers. Through these experiences, I continue to grow my expertise while contributing to the broader cloud-native ecosystem.</p>",

Over the last 3 years, she advocated for the adoption of open-source technologies within the Spanish-speaking community, creating and supporting tech meetups and events in the region. She co-created, along with her team, the first Kubernetes Community Days in Colombia. This event paved the way for the expansion of Cloud Native Groups throughout the region. Cristher's foresight and operational expertise have been fundamental to the success of both Cuemby and the Cloud Native Latam Group. Recognizing the region's need for in-depth knowledge of cloud-native applications, Cristher championed the LFS250 (Linux Foundation Course) and administered the KCNA certifications donated by CNCF to the region. These two initiatives heightened awareness of cloud-native technologies and certifications, fortifying local proficiency in open-source solutions. She continues to promote and advocate for the recognition of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) in the region, addressing both business and community aspects. Cristher's leadership and operational prowess exemplify her unwavering commitment to fostering a thriving Latam tech community. https://community.cncf.io/cloud-native-latin-america/ https://community.cncf.io/cloud-native-medellin/ https://www.cncf.io/reports/kcd-colombia-2023/ https://www.cuemby.com/about-us https://www.linkedin.com/company/fundaci%C3%B3n-hispana-de-cloud-native/?viewAsMember=true https://community.cncf.io/cloud-native-colombia/ https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/kcd-colombia/?viewAsMember=truehttps://www.linkedin.com/showcase/kcd-colombia</p><p>Why I am excited to be an ambassador: Becoming a CNCF ambassador empowers me to further my dedication to community growth in the LATAM region. I deeply believe that the region's success hinges on the symbiotic collaboration of professionals, students, and companies. It's this harmony that forms the core of my mission: to cultivate a thriving community ecosystem centered around open-source and cloud-native technologies. Through this role, I am positioned to amplify awareness about these technologies and the transformative opportunities they introduce. My operational and logistics expertise is set to facilitate more meetups and events, thus kindling the formation of new communities. Collaborating with fellow leaders and ambassadors provides a unique platform to unite our efforts, ensuring we collectively advance our shared vision.</p>",

Armed with coffee and an insatiable appetite for automation, I transform mundane tasks into elegant solutions while Kubernetes keeps me humble with its delightful complexities.  As a devoted servant of Jesus Christ, I approach technology with the same dedication as my faith. When not wrestling with cloud infrastructure, you'll find me exploring new technologies and tools, always curious to learn what's next in the tech world. I embrace a minimalist lifestyle, finding joy in simplicity both in code and in life.  My love affair with Kubernetes stems from its beautiful chaos - where community-driven solutions tackle real-world problems head-on. Like a digital shepherd, I guide applications through the cloud, learning and growing alongside an amazing community of problem solvers.  Think of me as your friendly neighbourhood automation enthusiast, fueled by coffee and powered by faith, always ready to transform complex challenges into elegant solutions. Because in the end, technology is not just about code - it's about building bridges and growing together.  Life's journey isn't just about conquering technical challenges; it's about leaving footprints of kindness and knowledge for others to follow. After all, the greatest legacy we can leave behind is not in the systems we build, but in the lives we touch through sharing and caring.  Personal Blog: https://bookofdaniel.in/</p>",

Physical to Virtual (P2V) and Virtual to Virtual (V2V) are the first experiences in virtualization projects that know the basics of cloud computing.  I started planning, assessing and building cloud computing in my company since the end of 2019 by conducting several cloud technology assessment tenders and selecting hyperscalers (cloud provider) according to my company's use cases. our challenge is how we maximize the benefits of cloud computing by migrating monolithic applications to microservices from on-premises to cloud using hyperscaler, with microservices we will have agile delivery to support rapid Go to Market (GTM) from a business point of view, we can support multiple deployments or sprint releases according to the business requirements program every week, it is much easier to maintain our applications / services independently and much more. Therefore, we realize the need to have microservices knowledge by understanding in-depth knowledge of the Kubernetes Platform to support this so that we will have an agile environment that can support our business growth and provide added value and competitive advantage for digital transformation in our company. I started learning Kubernetes from 2022 until now to support all kinds of applications/services migrating to microservices in the cloud. by fully understanding this knowledge we can maximize the value of kubernetes to support our business in our company.</p>",

This realization fueled continuous learning and self-improvement, leading to certifications in multiple cloud platforms, Kubernetes, and software testing. Outside of work, I'm a nature enthusiast with a strong interest in computer networking, storage, and systems reliability, especially within the cloud native solutions ecosystem.</p>",

The main focus being integrating those complex platforms in on-prem trusted, secured and compliant environments, as well as designing more hybrid setups in AWS and Azure.  Those state of the art container platforms bring tremendous agility features to micro services integration, but there are nothing without proper governance and without using the right tools sets depending on a wide range of contexts and use cases.  The cloud native world and its vast eco-system is evolving at high pace and today's challenge for many companies is to make sure they're not outrun by this strong wind of change in the digital transformation race. It's furthermore also important to understand all those concepts, the way they interact and their many impacts.</p>",

The role supports me in more actively engaging with a diverse global community, enabling me to learn from others whilst also sharing my own knowledge and expertise. As an Ambassador, I will contribute to thought leadership in the cloud native space and hope to provide an instrumental role in fostering a culture of knowledge sharing, learning and innovation. Throughout this journey, I am also eager to support and encourage others in pursuing CNCF Cloud Native certifications - an endeavour I am both passionate about and an advocate for. Overall, being a CNCF Ambassador is a highly rewarding and fulfilling experience that allows me to give back to the community while staying updated on the latest developments in the field.</p>",

I think cloud native is the future of software development and it can bring many benefits to users, developers, and businesses. I want to help the cloud native community grow and thrive by contributing to open-source projects, writing books and articles, and organizing events. Being an ambassador will give me more opportunities to connect with other cloud native enthusiasts and learn from their experiences. I hope to inspire more people to join the cloud native journey and make a positive impact on the world.</p>",
